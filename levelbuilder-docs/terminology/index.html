        Level pack
    </h2>
    <p>
        A level pack is defined in the editor as a folder containing the following:
        <ol>
            <li>
                Unity scene files
            </li>
            <li>
                <code>pack.json</code>
            </li>
        </ol>
        A level pack is defined by the game as a folder containing the following:
        <ol>
            <li>
                XML level files. These are generated automatically by the level builder and describe the contents of each level.
            </li>
            <li>
                <code>pack.json</code>. The level builder automatically copies this to the level pack automatically. 
            </li>
        </ol>
    </p>
    <h2>
        pack.json

    <p>
        This is a JSON file that contains metadata about your level pack. The game reads this file to determine, among other things, 
        <ul>
            <li>
                The order that your levels should be played in
            </li>
            <li>
                The gamemode your level pack is for
            </li>
            
        </ul>
    </p>
