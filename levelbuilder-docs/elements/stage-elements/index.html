    <h2>Level</h2>
    <p>
        <img src="level.png" class="thumbnail">
    </p>
    <p>
        This element is for your guidance only. It contains a floor plane and a lighting approximation. It does not get included in the built level. 
    </p>
    <br>
    <h2>Wall</h2>
    <p>
        <img src="wall.png" class="thumbnail">
        <img src="wall.png" class="thumbnail">
    </p>
    <p>
        This element is a simple wall. It cannot be destroyed and bullets bounce off of it. 
    </p>
    <br>
    <h2>Breakable Wall</h2>
    <p>
        <img src="wall-breakable.png" class="thumbnail">
        <img src="wall-breakable.png" class="thumbnail">
    </p>
    <p>
        This element is similar to a normal wall, but a mine explosion nearby will destroy it, enabling tanks to pass through its position.
    </p>
    <br>
    <h2>Glass Wall</h2>
    <p>
        <!--Image of block in builder-->
        <!--Image of block at runtime-->
    </p>
    <p>
        Like the breakable wall, a mine explosion will destroy it, but bullets will also damage it as they bounce off. 
    </p>
    <br>
    <h2>Hole</h2>
    <p>
        <img src="hole.png" class="thumbnail">
        <img src="hole.png" class="thumbnail">
    </p>
    <p>
        A hole prevents tanks from driving through its position, but bullets can fly over it.
    </p>
